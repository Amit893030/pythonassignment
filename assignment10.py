#Answers:
#1.Feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) involves extracting relevant features from input data to enable effective pattern recognition. CNNs use convolutional layers to apply filters to the input image, capturing low-level features such as edges, textures, and gradients. As the network progresses, deeper layers combine these low-level features to learn more complex and abstract features representative of the input data.

#2.Backpropagation is a fundamental process in training CNNs for computer vision tasks. It involves propagating the error from the output layer back through the network to adjust the weights and biases of the neurons. In computer vision tasks, the network's output is compared to the ground truth labels, and the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters is computed. This gradient is then used to update the weights through gradient descent, optimizing the network to minimize the error.

#3.Transfer learning is the process of utilizing pre-trained CNN models trained on large-scale datasets to solve new tasks with limited labeled data. The benefits of transfer learning include leveraging the learned representations from the pre-trained model, which can capture general visual features.
